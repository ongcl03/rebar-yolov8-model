# Rebar-YOLOv8-Model

## üéØ Overview

In construction and manufacturing, accurate rebar counts are crucial for quality control and inventory management. This notebook demonstrates how to:

1. **Merge** multiple rebar image datasets (from Roboflow)
2. **Train** a YOLOv8 object detector with augmentations for robust tiny-object performance
3. **Evaluate** using mAP@0.50 and mAP@0.50‚Äì0.95
4. **Infer** on new images and **visualize** bounding boxes and rebar counts

## üìä Model Performance

### üß† Object Detection Metrics (Validation Set)

| Metric        | Value | Description                                                                  |
| ------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Precision     | 0.983 | Proportion of predicted rebars that are correct                              |
| Recall        | 0.971 | Proportion of actual rebars correctly identified                             |
| F1-score      | 0.977 | Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall (balance of accuracy vs. completeness) |
| mAP@0.50      | 0.988 | Mean Average Precision at IoU ‚â• 0.50 ‚Äî measures detection quality            |
| mAP@0.50‚Äì0.95 | 0.743 | Stricter mean AP across multiple IoU thresholds (COCO-style metric)          |

### üî¢ Counting Metrics (Validation Set)

| Metric                         | Value              | Description                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Validation Images Processed    | 135                | Total number of validation samples                                                   |
| Mean Absolute Error (MAE)      | 4.393 rebars/image | Average number of rebars the model over- or under-counted per image                  |
| Counting Accuracy (COCO-style) | 96.82%             | Percentage of predictions within 10% of the ground truth (similar to COCO tolerance) |
| Exact-Match Accuracy           | 26.67%             | Percentage of images where the count matched ground truth exactly                    |

These results demonstrate that the YOLOv8-based model performs extremely well in rebar detection and is robust for practical use in counting tasks, even in dense or cluttered construction scenes.
