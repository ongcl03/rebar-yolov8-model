| ------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Precision     | 0.983 | Out of all rebars detected, 98.3% were correctly identified           |
| Recall        | 0.971 | Successfully found 97.1% of all rebars present in images              |
| F1-score      | 0.977 | Overall detection accuracy balancing precision and recall (97.7%)     |
| mAP@0.50      | 0.988 | 98.8% accurate detection with standard IoU threshold                  |
| mAP@0.50‚Äì0.95 | 0.743 | 74.3% accurate detection across strict IoU thresholds (COCO standard) |
