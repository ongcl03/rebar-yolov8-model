# 🚀 Rebar-YOLOv8-Model

## 🎯 Overview

In construction and manufacturing, accurate rebar counts are crucial for quality control and inventory management. This notebook demonstrates how to:

1. **Merge** multiple rebar image datasets (from Roboflow)
2. **Train** a YOLOv8 object detector with augmentations for robust tiny-object performance
3. **Evaluate** using mAP@0.50 and mAP@0.50–0.95
4. **Infer** on new images and **visualize** bounding boxes and rebar counts

## 🛠️ Quickstart

1. **Clone** this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/rebar-yolov8-model.git
   cd rebar-yolov8-model
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install ultralytics torch torchvision roboflow matplotlib opencv-python
   ```

3. **Open the notebook**:

   In your browser, run:
